## ⚠️ Honest Disclaimer

This project **doesn't actually work yet** (or may only partially work). It started with [someone else's excellent work](https://github.com/reisxd/HyperTizen), and most of the "development" was done by burning through way too many AI credits. There's a good chance that half the code is complete gibberish that just *looks* technical. Use at your own risk, and lower your expectations accordingly.

If you somehow find this useful, or just want to support questionable AI-driven development practices:

## About This Fork

This is an **experimental fork** of [HyperTizen](https://github.com/reisxd/HyperTizen) focused on exploring screen capture functionality for **Tizen 8.0+ TVs**. The original HyperTizen uses capture APIs that may have different availability on newer TV models. This fork provides a scaffolding structure for researching and implementing potential capture methods for Tizen 8.0+ compatibility.

### Status: Active Development

This fork is focused on implementing screen capture functionality for **Tizen 8.0+ TVs**.

**✅ Pixel Sampling Capture Method**: Now **IMPLEMENTED** using `libvideoenhance.so`
- Samples 16 pixels from screen edges for ambient lighting
- Converts 10-bit RGB to NV12 format for FlatBuffers transmission
- Supports both Tizen 6 and Tizen 7+ API variants
- Requires hardware testing to verify color accuracy and coordinate mapping
- Pretty bad performance, but it works! Sorta. Basically takes the dominant color on the screen. And flickering.

**⚠️ Other Capture Methods**: T8SDK and T7SDK remain as scaffolding (not yet implemented)

**Capture Architecture:** HyperTizen uses a systematic `ICaptureMethod` interface with automatic fallback. The `CaptureMethodSelector` tests available methods on startup (T8SDK → T7SDK → PixelSampling) and selects the first working method.

## How to Use the WebSocket Log Viewer

This fork includes a **real-time browser-based log viewer** that's essential for debugging on your TV.

### Accessing Logs

1. **Start HyperTizen** on your TV
2. **Open your browser** on any device on the same network
3. **Enter your IP:** `<YOUR_TV_IP>`, `45678`
4. The log viewer will automatically connect and display real-time logs

### Log Viewer Features

- **Real-time streaming**: See logs as they happen
- **Auto-reconnect**: Automatically reconnects if connection is lost
- **Exponential backoff**: Smart retry logic prevents connection spam
- **Color-coded output**: Easy to read and filter
- **Persistent across sessions**: Reconnects when TV restarts HyperTizen

### Finding Your TV's IP Address

You can find your TV's IP address in:
- **Settings** → **General** → **Network** → **Network Status** → **IP Settings**

Or use your router's admin panel to find connected devices.

### Example

```
http://192.168.1.100:45678
```

The log viewer (`logs.html`). This is particularly useful for debugging capture issues, monitoring performance, and understanding what's happening on the TV.

---

## Browser-Based Control Panel

In addition to logs, HyperTizen provides a **full control panel** accessible from any browser on your network.

### Accessing the Control Panel

1. **Start HyperTizen** on your TV
2. **Open on your browser** on any device on the same network
3. **Open the control panel:**
   - Download `controls.html` from this repository and open it locally, then enter your TV's IP

### Control Panel Features

The control panel (`controls.html`) provides the same functionality as the HyperTizenUI but through a standard browser:

**Service Control:**
- ▶️ Start/Stop capture
- ⏸️ Pause/Resume capture
- 🔄 Restart HyperTizen service
- 🌈 Rainbow border indicator when capturing

**SSDP Device Management:**
- 🔍 Scan for Hyperion/HyperHDR devices on your network
- ✓ Select and apply devices
- View device details (name, URL)

**Live Monitoring:**
- 📊 Real-time service status (state, FPS, frames captured, errors)
- 📋 Live log streaming (same as logs.html)
- ⏱️ Uptime and connection status
- 🔌 Dual WebSocket status indicators (control + logs)

**WebSocket Connections:**
- Port **45677**: Control WebSocket (send commands)
- Port **45678**: Logs WebSocket (receive logs)
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Persistent settings (saves TV IP in browser)

### Example


Open `controls.html` locally and enter:
```
TV IP: 192.168.1.100
Control Port: 45677
Logs Port: 45678
```

The control panel is perfect for:
- Managing HyperTizen from your phone/tablet/computer
- Testing capture without accessing the TV UI
- Monitoring service status during troubleshooting
- Selecting Hyperion/HyperHDR servers without using the TV remote

## What Works (and What Doesn't)

### Implemented & Functional

- **WebSocket Log Streaming**: Real-time debugging via browser (port 45678)
- **Browser-Based Control Panel**: Full service control and monitoring (control port 45677, logs port 45678)
- **Architecture Framework**: Structured `ICaptureMethod` interface with automatic fallback selection
- **System Info Detection**: Detects Tizen version and TV capabilities
- **Capture Method Selector**: Tests and selects best available capture method automatically
- **Log Level Filtering**: Client-side filtering in browser (Debug/Info/Warning/Error/Performance)
- **✅ Pixel Sampling Capture**: Full implementation using `libvideoenhance.so`
  - 16-point edge sampling for ambient lighting
  - 10-bit to 8-bit RGB conversion
  - RGB to NV12 color space conversion
  - FlatBuffers integration for HyperHDR/Hyperion
  - **Status**: Code complete, terrible

### Partially Implemented

- **T8SDK Capture Method**: Scaffolding exists, core implementation not yet added
- **T7SDK Capture Method**: Scaffolding exists, core implementation not yet added

### Known Issues & Testing Needed

**Pixel Sampling Method:**
- ⚠️ **Color accuracy**: Basically takes the dominant color on the screen
- **Flickering**: Random white flicker now and then

### Testing the Pixel Sampling Implementation

To test the pixel sampling capture method on your Tizen 8.0+ TV:

1. **Build and install** the updated HyperTizen package on your TV
2. **Start the service** and monitor via WebSocket logs
3. **Watch for log messages** showing:
   - `PixelSampling: Library found, available`
   - Color values being sampled (10-bit RGB)
4. **Connect to HyperHDR/Hyperion** and verify ambient lighting displays correctly
5. **Test color accuracy**: Display pure colors (red, green, blue) and verify they appear correctly
6. **Test edge mapping**: Move content along edges and verify LEDs respond in correct direction

### Research Notes on Tizen 8.0+ Capture

- **Standard APIs**: May have different availability on Tizen 8.0+ compared to earlier versions
- **VideoEnhance Library**: `libvideoenhance.so` provides pixel sampling API that works on Tizen 6, 7, and 8+
- **Alternative Methods**: VTable-based frame capture (T8SDK) and legacy APIs (T7SDK) require further research
- **Framework Differences**: Tizen 8.0+ has architectural changes that affect some capture capabilities
